//! Domain types and rules shared by every Swarmy service. No I/O, no clock, no network.
//!
//! An agent is data: an append-only event log, a snapshot, and a durable volume. This
//! crate defines the identifiers, events, and state machines those services agree on.
//! See `docs/DESIGN.md` for the design this crate implements.
